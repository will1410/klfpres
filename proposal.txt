[Opening slide - title]

[Question slide]

How many of you had already heard of the Koha open source project before you read the description of this presentation in the conference program or on the conference website?

And I'm talking about the Koha project used in libraries - not the dog food company.

[]

I'm not surprised because knowing whether or not your library uses Koha is kind of like knowing the name of the software that your bank uses to manage your accounts or knowing the name of the software that the city uses to track your water bill.

[bank slide - water slide - library slide]

Software packages like this affect people all over the country - all over the world - but usually only the people that work industries like banking or city management know the names of the software packages they use or know which companies sell those products.  And the same is true for library systems.  Millions of people visit libraries all over the world every day - in Kansas alone, almost 38,000 people visit a public library every day - that's over 13,500,000 library visits a year - and that's in a state with only about 2.5 million people.

My name is George Williams and my official title is "Next Search Catalog Coordinator" for Northeast Kansas Library System in Lawrence.  I'm also currently the president of koha-US.  Today I'm going to talk about the Koha open source Integrated Library System.  I'll talk a bit about its history, and the Koha community and the use of Koha by libraries worldwide, in the US, and in Kansas.

I'm here for two reasons.

Firstly, one of my coworkers suggested this conference to me, so I looked at the conference website to see if there was a schedule or a list of presentations.  And there wasn't, but when I saw that the call for proposals there were 10 proposed topics and four of them stood out to me as things that I actually knew something about.  The first two that stood out were "Open source software and programming languages," and "Communities built around open source technology" and those both apply to Koha.  But two of the other suggested topics were "Open knowledge and education," and "Anything else considered 'open'." Both of these ideas are at the center of what's called "New librarianship" which is something I believe in.

"The mission of librarians is to improve society through facilitating knowledge creation in their communities." David Lankes - Atlas of New Librarianship - University of South Carolina

So I thought about all the times I've talked to library people about Koha and thought this might be a good place to go to talk to non-library people about Koha because Koha is an unqualified open source success story.

Koha is known by many in the library world but outside of libraries, Koha does not have a big profile.


The Koha ILS was the first Open Source ILS in the world.  It's used by thousands of libraries throughout the world - definitely more than any other open source ILS.  It's used on all 7 continents.  And it is possibly used by more libraries than any other single ILS.  I add the qualifier "possibly" on this one because there's no undisputable data to back up that assertion.  It's estimated that as many as 15,000 libraries are now using Koha, but there's no was to verify that.



Normally when I talk about Koha I'm talking to library people at library conferences or things like that, so normally when I talk about Koha, I usually have to spend a few minutes explaining "Open Source."  Since there aren't any library people here today, I thought I'd get into the history of Koha by doing a 2 minute history of ILS in general.  ILS stands for Integrated Library System.

The beginning is back in the 1960s when someone at a library said, "Hey, instead of putting all of our metadata on 3x5 cards in a card catalog, why don't we put it in a computer file.  Then instead of having separate Title, Author, and Subject cards for each title, we could just have 1 record for each title that could be searched 3 different ways."  And somebody said, "Hey, great idea, let's do that."

And while the catalogers were doing that, someone in the circulation department said, "Hey, instead of storing all of our patron data on little 3x5 cards behind the circulation desk, why don't we put that data on a computer, then it would be easier to store and search through that data."  And somebody said "Hey, great idea, let's do that."

And after those two projects were underway, somebody else came along and said "Hey, why don't we INTEGRATE these two systems and add an inventory control module so we can track which patron has which book?"  And somebody said "Hey, we could make money selling computer systems that do all that."

Starting around 1975, there were several companies selling computer systems to libraries to do, mostly, these three things and that's what the most basic ILS does - cataloging, patron records, and circulation.  But since the beginnings in the 1970s many other features have been added including Acquisitions, Serials, Course Reserves, Authority Control, and, of course, web based patron access catalogs.

In the early 70s there were just a few companies that offered integrated library systems - Computer Library Systems Incorporated (CLSI) - GEAC Library Solutions - NOTIS (Northwestern Online Total Integrated System).  By the mid-80s, though, there were about 25-30 companies worldwide, and by the late 90s those 25-30 companies were merging into just the handful that we have today.

Really, right now, the only companies that have systems that are viable for large scale use are Proquest, Innovative, SirsiDynix
Follett, TLC, and OCLC.

Koha comes into the picture in 1999.  At the beginning of 1999, The Horowhenua Trust Library in Levin New Zealand discovered that the system they were using had 2 problems.  The first was a Y2K bug.  The second was that they couldn't update the software because it was proprietary and the company that made it had gone out of business.

First they sent out a standard RFP to all the usual vendors.  The responses they got were #1, too expensive, and #2, didn't meet their needs.  So, after the failed RFP, they turned to a local company called Katipo Communications and asked them if they could write an ILS that met all of their needs and have it ready to use by January 3, 2000.

And part of the agreement they reached with Katipo when they wrote their contract for the development was that the end result would be free and open source.

They decided to call the software Koha.  The name Koha comes from Maori word for gift - but it's a gift with strings of reciprocity [need slides]



Throughout the year they worked through this cycle of development, testing, and redevelopment.  Then on January 3, 2000, Koha went live at the Library in Levin.  And Koha 1.0 was released worldwide in June, 2000.  At that point, 4 people have code in Koha.  By the end of January 2001, 5 people have code in Koha.  https://slides.com/ranginui/pakistan-koha-conference-2019#/3

From 2001-2005 Bugzilla is set up to track issues, community starts a Wiki, MARC support is added, by the end of 2005, 39 people have code in Koha.

2006-2010 - KohaCon begins.  Moved to Git.  Zebra search engine is added.  Major crisis - the LibLime Fork.  By the end of 2010, 130 people have code in Koha.

2011-2015 - Release schedule is set to 2 times per year - May and November.  Liblime fork is resolved.  By the end of 2015, 305 people have code in Koha.

2016-present - Community re-organizes construction of the Koha documentation.  Support for ElasticSearch is added.  Support begins to move from MySQL to MariaDB.  50 companies worldwide are offering support for Koha - In the US, the biggest two companies are ByWater Solutions and Equinox Software.  Over 400 people have code in Koha.

The things that the Koha community value are Coopetition - One Koha - Open Meetings - Transparancy - Consensus - Inclusivity - Robust development process.

Kansas --






























My job title is, therefore, meaningless unless you know that "Next Search Catalog" is the name of the shared library catalog that NEKLS operates on behalf of 51 libraries in the northeastern corner of the state.  Operating a shared catalog means that you can get a card at Leavenworth Public Library and use that same card at the library in Ottawa.  It also means that when our patrons do a search in our online catalog, they're searching the collections of all 51 libraries at once.  Someone from Seneca can see what's owned at the library in Osage City, and because of our courier network, a patron from one library can request items from any other library in the system and get
