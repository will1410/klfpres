How many of you had heard of the Koha open source Integrated Library System before you read the description of this presentation in the conference program?

[The number will be low]

I'm not surprised because knowing about Koha is kind of like knowing about the software that your bank uses to manage your accounts or knowing the name of the software that the city uses to track your water bill.  Those software packages affect people all over the country - probably all over the world, but usually only people that work in those industries know the names of those software packages or know which companies sell those products.  And the same is true for library systems.  Millions of people visit libraries all over the world every day - in Kansas alone, almost 38,000 people visit the library every day - that's over 13,500,000 library visits a year in a state with only about 2.5 million people.

So, my name is George Williams and I'm the "Next Search Catalog Coordinator" for Northeast Kansas Library System in Lawrence.  Today I'm going to talk about the Koha open source Integrated Library System.  I'll talk a bit about its history, and the Koha community and the adoption of Koha by libraries worldwide, in the US, and in Kansas.  Koha is an open source success story.  Koha is known by many in the library world but outside of the library world, it does not have much of a profile.  Because of its impact on libraries and the impact of libraries on the people they serve, Koha has an indirect impact on people all over the world.  Because it's an open source success story, I thought I'd let you all know what's going on.
