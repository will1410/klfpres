  A. Me - George Williams - Next Search Catalog Coordinator at Northeast Kansas Library System
    1. Next Search Catalog is a shared catalog in Northeast Kansas with 51 member libraries.  I'll talk more about that later.
    2. I'm also currently the president of koha-US - an organized Koha users group here in the USA
    3. I've been involved in the Koha community since 2011 when I was working at the Latah County Library District in north central Idaho.
    4. How I ended up as a systems librarian is a long story.  I never planned on being a librarian - especially not a systems librarian.  After my father died when I was 19 I dropped out of college and when I was 26 I was a bus driver who decided to go back to college.  Going back to college landed me a part time work-study job at the University of Idaho Library and then my wife needed to move to Boise for a job and because I had library experience plus a Class B CDL, 2 years later I ended up as a part time college student at Boise State University working full time as the Bookmobile Driver for Boise Public Library.
